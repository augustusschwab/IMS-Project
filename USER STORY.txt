USER STORY

AS AN inventory manager, I want to monitor, and adjust inventory quantities
SO THAT i am able to order needed items 


ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

WHEN I visit my inventory management application
AND there is a sidebar with options to: add, remove, view, and order inventory
AND there are two dynamic displays that show the number of current inventory by category (ex: 3 brushes), 
and items needing to be ordered
WHEN I click on the "add inventory" button, I am prompted to enter my logg-in information, then taken to a customizable form where I can input "category", "product name", "quantity", "location".
WHEN I submit my updated form, I am presented with a confirmation message, asking whether I want to add more inventory, or am finished adding inventory
WHEN I hit "finished", I am taken to the main webpage where I can see my updated dynamic displays
